Windwos Driver Model drivers are kernel-mode drivers built around the concept of IRPs (I/O Request Packets) and a defined entry/dispatch system

DriverEntry is hte kernel driver's main entry point like (main() in apps)
it is responsible for:
	+Setting dispatch routines
	+ Creating device objects
	+ Creating symbolic links
	+ Initializing driver-wide resources

IRPs are data structures used by Windows to communicate with drivers
Common IRP Major Functions:
	+ IRP MJ Create (open handle)
	+IRP MJ_CLOSE
	+IRP MJ_READ
	+IRP MJ_WRITE
	+IRP MJ DEVICE CONTROL (IOCTLS)
	+ IRP MJ CLEANUP

1. DbgPrint() / KdPrint() is to Print logs to kernel debugger / DebugView
166 these are are part of Windows kernel-mode API, which is written in C or C++ -> you can program in any language to call normal windows apis but C and C++ will be faster coz they compile directly to native code
*****BUT Only a very small set of languages can call Windows kernel APIs, and the only practical ones are C and C++

2.⭐ User Mode APIs
	Can be called from many languages
	C/C++ are fastest, but others work fine
	Languages run in user mode and are safe
  ⭐ Kernel Mode APIs
	Only callable by code running in kernel mode
	Only drivers and the kernel itself use these
	Practically only C/C++/Rust/ASM can be used
	Dangerous and highly restricted

3.a sys file is a kernel driver -> Windows must load it through kernel loader  -> sys file is loaded into kernel's address space -> Windows calls DriverEntry -> Driver now runs kernel mode

4. Syscalls are 1000x slower because they switch the CPU from user mode to kernel mode, which is expensive
