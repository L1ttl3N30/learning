1. device objects
- is the kernel's representation of the driver's "device" - a virtual kernel object
- user-mode program interact with the drivers though this device object using CreateFile, DeivceIoControl
- when a driver loads:
	+ a device object is created
	+ a symbolic link is created so user-mode can open it

- a symboliclink is a user-mode-visible name like \\.\MyDriver
	it's like /dev/<mydevice> in ubuntu
	it allows user-mode to open the driver with CreateFile

2. IOCTL (i/o control codes)
- IOCTLs are commands that user-mode sends to the driver
- a 32-bit IOCTL encodes:
	+device type
	+ Function number
	+ Method for passing buffers
	+ Required access rights
- communication between user and kernel occurs via:
	+ METHOD_BUFFERED (beginners-safest/easiest)
	+ METHOD_IN_DIRECT/OUT_DIRECT (DMA-friendly)
	+ METHOD_NEITHER (dangerous, requires strict validation)

- User<->Driver flow
	+ User mode: DeviceIoControl(handle, IOCTL_X, input,inSize,output,outSize...)
	+ Driver receives an IRP with a parameter IOCTL_X
	+ Driver dispatches
	+ inside your code: 
			switch (IOCTL_X)
			{
			    case IOCTL_1: call Handler1();
			    case IOCTL_2: call Handler2();
			    ...
			}
	+ Driver executes handler
	+ Driver completes IRP
	+ User receives output
