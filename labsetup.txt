setting up tails (live) is as easy as it gets
same thing with kali live.
the problem starts with persistence
#command
wipefs -a /dev/sdX
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX <<< $(printf "p\nn\np\n\n\n\np\nw") #create a new partition from empty sapce
mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdXN
sudo mkdir -pv /mnt/my_usb
sudo mount -v /dev/sdXN /mnt/my_usb
#getting stuck here -> superblock has an invalid journal
#spent 8 hours herew wiping and remaking usb live 
# maybe the problem happens when creating new partition with fdisk, maybe the partition was not properly unmounted

sudo e2fsck -l badsectors.txt /dev/sdXN #to check for bad sectors (dont run when mounted)
echo "/ union" | sudo tee /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf #make file 
umount -v /dev/sdXN
reboot

day 2 of continuing this
- trying to check for bad sectors
	e2fsck -l badsectors.txt /dev/sda3
getting error: superblock has in invalid journal
		reading_bad_blocks_file: nos such for or directory

- trying to find if that file exist
	find / -name badsectors.txt 2>/dev/null
getting nothing

-trying to build that file
	badblocks -sv /dev/sda3 > badsectors.txt
getting pass completed, 0 bad blocks found

- rechecking with e2fck still gets superblock has an invalid journal

- just remembered when using rufus: set the size for persistence to be 0
- 2 options now: rebuild with 
	sudo dd if=kali-linux-2025.3-live-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync bs=4M status=progress
	or again on windows


-before that: tried tune2fs -j /dev/sda3 --> block bitmap mismatch
-> sudo e2fsck -fy /dev/sda3 #force repair everything
- still getting the same error: suspect hardware problem
-> sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sda (this is gonna take a few hours again)
