setting up tails (live) is as easy as it gets
same thing with kali live.
the problem starts with persistence
#command
wipefs -a /dev/sdX
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX <<< $(printf "p\nn\np\n\n\n\np\nw") #create a new partition from empty sapce
mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdXN
sudo mkdir -pv /mnt/my_usb
sudo mount -v /dev/sdXN /mnt/my_usb
#getting stuck here -> superblock has an invalid journal
#spent 8 hours herew wiping and remaking usb live 
# maybe the problem happens when creating new partition with fdisk, maybe the partition was not properly unmounted

sudo e2fsck -l badsectors.txt /dev/sdXN #to check for bad sectors (dont run when mounted)
echo "/ union" | sudo tee /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf #make file 
umount -v /dev/sdXN
reboot
